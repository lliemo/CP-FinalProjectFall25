# Development #2

## What's Changed?

### The Whole Concept at this point:

1. no longer an adventure game due to time => now is a sight-reading/improv game where you play the given note within the given timeframe
2. Visuals are completed, some mechanics still need work:
   a. speed rate must gradually increase over time
   b. MIDI input must be connected to onscreen obstacles with if, else statement
   i. allow game to continue if midi matches note on obstacle => if you reach far side of obstacle, game over
   c. IF THERE'S TIME:
   i. play with oscillator sound type and polyphony
   ii. don't allow obstacles to overlap
